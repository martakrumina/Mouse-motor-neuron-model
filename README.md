This code is a part of a masters thesis, which investigates how extracellular electric fields, applied via tsDCS, influence the electrophysiological behavior of spinal motor neurons. 
Using computational modeling, we aim to gain a better understanding of the morphological and biophysical factors that shape neuronal responses to stimulation.

We developed morphologically realistic, multi-compartment models mouse alpha-motor neurons using the NEURON simulation environment. 
Simulations were conducted with and without applied extracellular electric fields of varying orientations.
Electrophysiological parameters,including rheobase, input resistance, resting membrane potential, and latency to peak, were analyzed across multiple morphologies. 

Electric field stimulation modulated neuronal excitability in a direction and morphology dependent manner. Greater dendritic extent, soma size, 
and asymmetry were associated with larger changes in excitability. Notably, the alignment of the field with the dendritic axis significantly enhanced polarization effects. 
These findings were consistent across the mouse morphologies, but varied in magnitude, highlighting morphology-specific responses relevant to ALS modeling.

To run the code you will need the NEURON simulation environment and python jupiter notebook. Download the attached folder and run the jupyther notebook file, you might need to re-run the first line of code twice in order to fully compile the .mod files before continuing to run the simulations themselves.
